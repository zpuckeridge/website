# Personal Website and CV

The goal of this project was to create a minimal and simplistic, easy to read personal website and CV to use when applying for jobs.

I am currently in the process of migrating my Ghost Blog to HTML for easy customisation. I will be investigating the development of my own dashboard for article management.
